Constantly in the land of [[We Are The Resources]] one is reminded that success comes from amassing Event Horizons that have an insane amount of gravity. When you collect Event Horizons together though you put your business at extreme risk.

How? **Event Horizons create alliances.**

A truly effective Event Horizon has identified that the Network Effect is the most powerful tool they have in their arsenal. Not reliant on any one company or any single idea, an Event Horizon has the true ability to remain nimble (likely because they have always had to be.)

Unfortunately for the company though, Event Horizons assemble to become a Black Hole that destroys everything in its path.

While a company views the integration of an Event Horizon as an asset, is an increasing liability that puts the company and all team members at risk with the strong reliance and _key-man_ inclusion that requires significant change when the team disperses.

In the past week and with the acquired understanding of [[We Are The Resources]] this is already becoming an issue for Flipside and we are only 5 months into employment:

Unfortunately though, this is the perfect display of Event Horizons coming together to create blackholes.

If something happened to Meg, Drake cannot go back in time and will not take that role which means Drake will begin looking for a new job and figuring out how to adjust to the change without traveling back in time.

Focusing on event horizons to an extreme degree is a severe mistake that only leaders incapable of the process of execution will choose to support.

Supporting event horizons with freedom is not the choice of a smart CEO or one that knows where they are going, they are lost to an extreme degree putting the trust in people they literally cannot comprehend the thoughts of.
