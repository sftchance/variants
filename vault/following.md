[Arkham](https://www.arkhamintelligence.com/) has entered the web3 industry without any of its founders having a huge following before or after building. Even when the product is rather known today and has gone through multiple rounds of funding, the prime founder still only has 500 followers.

This is just one of many reference points that illustrates multiple points but primarily:

1. Your business can be successful without you being viral, known on Twitter, or really even posting. All that is needed is a good product that can be talked about.
2. Miguel has 106 tweets and 90% of them are about the product.
   1. Shitposting can do more harm than good, especially for investors.

Meanwhile, the company Twitter has 37k followers.

They built a product that users enjoy and value and that has resulted in a community that shows up and supports the company. This is nicely illustrated with the metrics of their **product-focused tweets** such as: https://twitter.com/ArkhamIntel/status/1579812848758587392?s=20&t=YBwR2Sz13K_VUxLdvEfPA

Interestingly, while the company has not strayed away from shitposting, Arkham has also shown that one does not have to be completely serious to market a very serious and very good product.

Arkham is a great example of the land that many products aspire to stand in. They have taken a far more meme-heavy route and have a managed person leading the social media now. While that may be the case one day for Cogs, that is not the case on Day 0.

To siphon the wisdom for Arkham, Cogs will lead the topical and emergent things such as [[Content Topics]] while also utilization [[Content Marketing]] for more long-term and longtail focuses.

> Just because you do not have a following when starting, does not mean your [[Total Addressable Market]] is any smaller than the next guys.
