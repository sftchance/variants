The creation of [[Appetite Driven Development]] establishes the base foundation with the newfound understanding that the best thing to build will always be what the user wants.

Based on the learnings of [[Value Driven Development]] in combining the users appetite to have a solution and the supporting teams appetite to solve, we correct many of the fundamental issues specified in [[Value Driven Development]].

A strict nuance though is that appetite does not solely live in the hands of the users nor the developers.

Built on the learnings from [[Shape Up]], this is a manner of operating which systemizes the process of determining if the appetite exists to solve a problem or not.

Critical to note, appetite is not emotional, but completely reliant on the logical consideration of impact and problem-solving weight that can be delivered to a user at a given and afforded cost.
