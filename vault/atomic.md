> Builds on top of the [[Hyper MetricsDAO]] concept that is being pioneered to redefine that a global workforce contributes and creates value together.

Let's be real, DAOs are ineffective more often than not. Moving slowly to make any decision, requiring complex arbitration policies, and living upon mechanisms of recourse that move so slow the window of opportunity could pass, DAOs have a _getting work done_ problem.

People are lazy. DAOs, they are even lazier. Without incentive an individual has no reason to work or contribute. [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/), an [L2 roll-up](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/layer-2-scaling-zk-rollup-optimistic-rollup-ethereum), has adopted retroactive public-good funding that aims to add the most value to the teams contributing to the ecosystem. DAOs, have been following a very similar model without even realizing it. Although, there is one key nuance.

- A product or company has the ability to grow and create value without the guidance of a single person for every cent of value created.

Individuals operating in a collective do not have such an idealistic situation they can partake in, though. A designer that is working for a DAO cannot create art without being active nor can they consider value created without a deliver good. Unless operating on trust, it is almost a certainty that a backward-looking compensation flow is being provided rather than forward-looking compensation.

Crtiically, not only do participants of a DAO not have the ability to create value without active contribution, the DAO also has no way to ensure that valuable contribution continues. As the proliferation of on-chain organizations continues to seep through the deepest corner of Web3, the access of Liquid Labor has increased with every passing day.

- With bounty systems.
- With scavenger hunts.
- With democratized service facilitation.

The world is changing, individuals have adapted, corporations are suffering, the world is resigning, yet DAOs find themselves lacking the ability to truly hold an individual accountable outside of no longer paying them. This means, that during the transitionary phase of a participant exiting, contribution and incentive is not just spent inefficiently, but quite literally wasted for all parties involved.

Imagine this scenario, a developer is _"employed"_ to handle the development of a new version of a protocol. Progress is fast and large in the beginning. Yet, when the first audit comes back the response to handling issues is not taken care of. Months go by, absolutely zero progress is made and a DAO with a product adopted by hundreds reaches a complete halt.

- Does the individual still have claim to the compensation earned for their original contributions?
- How does one determine the amount of compensation the individual has earned?
- What can be done to address the conclusion of contributions?

The list of nuanced questions is endless and does not stop for as long as the work is being completed by a DAO.

Let's imagine a more dire scenario. You've taken a seed position in an incredible DAO that is building a _product for the future_. It checks all the boxes and everything is looking incredible. They have a real product, they have real clients and most importantly they have people in the market that are willing to pay them money for the value created.

So much value in fact, that a client comes along and signs a two-year deal. It goes well in the beginning, but just a few months into the process the DAO can no longer offer the service at the same quality. The market has grown, the DAO team has changed and the technical capacity is no longer matched.

Of course the client could just stop paying, but that assumes that the organization didn't require the locking of partial funds in [escrow](https://www.rocketmortgage.com/learn/what-is-escrow). If they did, how can the client get the DAO working again or get their funds back? Unless deliberately given that ability, there is likely no path of recourse. The DAO and deal are dead and the only thing that can reinvoragate the value creation is if a team shows up to drive the value once again.

Even binary DAO-team acquisitions have been few and far between, it will be a very long time before web3 organization buy-outs become common place. So, what can be done about the critical ineffiencies that essentially make one incapable of trusting a DAO for long-term value creation?

The first piece of the solution is democratizing the workforce to create _Liquid Labor_. A market of extremely interested and incentivized individuals to complete a work request to the best of their ability.

For example, smart contract audits have been largely inefficient for literal years with a few set of eyes looking over a contract with a far-too limited set of knowledge and expertise. Exploits slip through the cracks, protocols are bankrupted and insurance funds are drained.

Rather than allowing the issue to persist, [code4rena](https://code4rena.com/) enables democratized and heavily incentivized contributions. It is not a discreet business solely chasing profits, it is a collective of developers auditing smart contracts together for a stake at their piece of the pie.

Exploits and issues being spotted are valuable regardless the socia-economic state of the contributor and discrimination at any level is unjust and unfair. With a democratized process, every single person is empowered to be their best in the chase to the rise to the top of an egocentric market.

Smart contract audits are not the only niche of the workforce that _liquid labor_ will prove to be incredibly effective for. Imagine a democratic market for:

- Analytics services such as [MetricsDAO](https://metricsdao.xyz).
- Writing / editing services such as [EssayService](https://essayservice.com/).
- Fund strategy management such as [Cian](https://dapp.cian.app/).

The list of markets that will benefit from a democratized workforce generally boils down to service industries. A business selling a good will find it difficult to write their contributions to a public ledger due to the lack of discrete value creation until the time of sale.

Imagine the world in which you have a problem, there is a collective with the expertise and capabilitiy to your problem, all you have to do is ask for help to receive a fairly priced and extremely high quality deliverable. Perfect contestability and competition drive qualities and effiency operations to levels that some may even consider concerning. Regardless of the fear, slamming the breaks due to lack of mental fortitude is weak and enlightening of an establishments position in the future of a decentralized economy.

Democratized workforces and liquid labor will only become more prevalent in the coming years. Thought you had seen the "_Great Resigning_" already? Wow, do I have news for you. You have seen nothing yet.

Thought the "_unemployment rates_" reached high levels during COVID-19? [18 million people leaving the traditional workforce](https://www.bls.gov/cps/effects-of-the-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic.htm) will look like a blip as the global workforce continues to coalesce towards the death of conglomerates, governments and imaginary nation borders that have far too much control over **_the value a contributor can create_**. Central banking moving digital? Please. The migration of money will be just a tiny needle in the haypile of labor migration.

Personally, I have no interest in being on the wrong side of history on this one. For so long, society was worried about _automation_ taking peoples job when all along they should have been scared of the _atomization_.

Addressing the elephant in the room though, the final ideation of liquid labor will not come in the form of bounties. It is incredibly inefficient and would cause a massive amount of issues that one cannot justify for any organization attempting to operate with a sense of urgency or quality.

Contrary to the implementation of today's bounty systems that are used as a user acquisition marketing mechanism, the true workforce will not be so lacking of thought.

With the introduction of value-driven facilitation, a _Labor Market_ will soon arise to fulfill the needs of a more mature workforce. Focused on capital effiency and quality deliverables, a collective offering liquid labor is extremely powerful. Being early to democratized workforces is very comparable to the companies that adopted remote work before COVID forced many companies to adopt that work style without choice.

Traditionally, the consumption of a real-world good does not come at the time of it being delivered. However, that is not true for digital services nor digital workforces. Also standing in contrast is that quality enforcement in the real-world with a centralized subset of maintainers is far simpler than an open-draw of digital cattle.

This means, that an individual can contribute value directly to a market that values them at a transparent and fair-to-the-market rate. Competition can breed at the foot of the raw compensation as the loss of geo-political barriers that keep global individuals from earning their fair share of the pie grows into an unstoppable collective of people that have for the first time in history, become truly aligned.

Just one problem, while the sourcing and enforcement of service quality can solely be economically incentivized. Atomic quality enforcement is nearly impossible unless heavily and consistently incentivized, that of which is extremely difficult to accomplish for a decentralized body of individuals; whether hand-picked or not.

Human beings are fickle and the desires and preferences of a single person change at whim with little sign of coming change. For DAOs, that drive on-chain value, this can be an even more difficult scenario. Importantly, scale or market-impact has little to do with the odds of a collective remaining effective and active within the ecosytem as time unfolds.

To this, OpenGSN, one of the most impactful DAOs in the Web3 space, entered development of version 3 at the start of 2022, and now 10 months later it is still sitting in beta with no announcement in 3 months, a broken website and no public plans of completing initial development or managing further maintenance of the resulting product.

Most concerningly, [OpenGSN](https://opengsn.org/) is backed by the [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.org/en/foundation/) and [MakerDAO](https://makerdao.com/en/). Even with support of a couple of the most impactful bodies of people in the space, as a decentralized organization, OpenGSN has proven that named backing carries little weight as they can still die at the hands of time and obligation. Really, if anything it appears as if DAOs create more technical debt than the resulting product ends up being worth.

Further, due to legal requirements that a company cannot guide a token-drven DAO for all of time, DAOs are used as a mechanism of ownership forfeiture creating a headless organization lacking real leadership; yet things must still be done! DAOs do not hold eternal value. Much like their participants, the system must actively be maintained which means that without doing so, the organization will find itself boarded up and closed as the market writes them into the history books.

A new future is coming. A workforce of requesters, providers, and enforcers. While previously thought to be managed with simple economic incentives, today we are exploring a different model. In the delivery of services there are three key steps:

- Negotiation: price discovery for rendered services.
- Production / Delivery: the creation and submission of digital deliverable.
- Enforcement: the quality scoring and determination of relative payment earned.

This means, that regardless of the millions of activities that could have taken place before completion of delivery, in order to consistently facilitate high-quality work there must be trusted enforcement.

Holistically, a deliverables value _should_ be directly proportional to its quality. Rarely, if ever, would a requester be capable of accepting a delivered service that is subpar. Think of it as a _Satisfaction Guarantee_. For if a delivered service does not meet the expectation of standards, objectively one should not be equally compensated nor should the requester be expected to be pleased with the results. So if you have a liquid market, requesters are active, and providers are submitting records of deliverables on-chain, how can quality be truly enforced? One can let things play in the chaotic field of economic equilibrium or even adopt the ideals of the current market that believes a reputation token alone is enough to keep a system running.

If you're not familar, the idea of a _usage value-representing reputation token_ is that an individual can earn without the ability to transfer the token or realize swap-financial value. However, because it's earned through usage, it also makes sense for it to also be consumed to gain deeper access. In greater depth, a reputation token would be minted into the ecosystem through value-creating actions and could be leveraged to gain access to higher levels of permissions that assist in securing the network.

This means, that as an individual contributes to a network they are earning local reputation. Local reputation that can in turn be used to further increase their stake, financial return and overall access depending on the model implementation.

With this, a contributor of a network can grow into an enforcer that has the ability to guide the overall quality of the market. However, there is a far more interesting model few have even considered: _top-down management paired with enforcer obligation_.

With this, an organization has the ability to bootstrap a foundational subset of labor and operational knowledge. With a functioning system to earn local reputation, participants can self-manage their impact inside an organization.

The focus of an atomic enforcement mechanism is to:

- Create obligation for enforcers.
- Create a way to restore reputation deficit.
- Offer a way to fire/disparty an individual without a manual process.
- Add further volition and accuracy to a measure of network capacity.

This means as a high-level participant one could literally be required to contribute a certain level of assurance and network backing. With a dynamic rate and schedule, an organization can define the level of expectation that is carried for every second of eternity.

Hate the idea of an 8-5? **_Welcome to the world of 24/7 obligations_**. Don't want this? Don't share this paper and help it stay quiet.

In practice, this would result in a simple verification process like:

```python
def maintainer_status(networkParticipantAddress, operationsSeen, operationsDeclared):
  if networkParticipantAddress is not in operationsSeen:
    return HEALTHY
  min_work_required = operationsSeen[networkParticipantAddress] // 48
  if min_work_required <= operationsDeclared[networkParticipantAddress] + THROTTLE_BUFFER:
    return HEALTHY
  elif min_work_required <= opsIncluded[networkParticipantAddress] + BAN_BUFFER:
    return THROTTLED
  return BANNED
```

What does this look like in practice? Let's lay out an example.

Imagine there is an free and open market where individuals can come ask a question, associate a certain amount of funding and have the answer looked over by a third party before payment.

Hundreds of providers submit a deliverable yet it is very difficult for the requester to determine which submission is the best. Without the vital piece of quality enforcement, a provider could submit nonsense and still receive their payment which is an unacceptable outcome. So, enforcers are incentivized financially to participate. However, financial incentivization is enough to create a level of security for the organization in it's operational runway.

By creating obligation to show up and continue work, one must make the conscious decision _to not participate_ rather than _to participate_. This, being the absolute critical piece of information one cannot glance over. With this nuance, this means that an organization can hold their contributors accountable while also maintaing the ability to more rapidly fill a hole when one does become available.

Of course, there is lacking depth in this solution as only very specific tasks will truly benefit from the atomization of labor accessibility. However, for binary (or close to) tasks, atomization can be largely impactful. Yet, this model has its own downsides. A major one being that participants are still human beings and they should not be treated as if they are robots.

Simply, one can offer the ability to freeze their reputation (and the obligation).

-- no idea how to end?
