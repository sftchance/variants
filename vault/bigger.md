Often times recently many of the fundamental disagreements that I have had with peoples perception of the world comes from them lacking the realization that their are levels of the system higher than they can perceive.

Believing the world to be a blue ocean, they are under the impression they can see the whole ocean while only seeing to the horizon.

Holistically, it is simple to identify these people by determining if they believe that things can happen without a certain level of guidance.

If they say yes, they have a very narrow perspective of the world and they need someone to show them the rails the train runs on.

> One strand of empirical research that is relevant to questions concerning the role of consciousness in agency is the work on automaticity; in particular, the research on automatic goal pursuit. It has been shown, for instance, that the goal to perform a certain task accurately can be primed, so that the agent pursues the goal without any awareness of doing so (Bargh et al. 2001). There is a large body of research on this, and it has been suggested that this research shows that *most* of our actions are executed automatically and without conscious control (Bargh and Chartrand 1999, Custers and Aarts 2010).[[22](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/agency/notes.html#note-22)] This claim is less radical than the claims put forward by Libet (1999) and Wegner (2002), as it concerns only the extent or scope of conscious control.
