Constantly surrounded by people that do actions merely looking to get a response, they must be treated like little siblings. A stream of frustration and annoyance, those with an [[Attention Seeking Behavior]] rarely provide any level of impact or perspective.

Instead, it <author author="nftchance" created="03/02/2023" note="Revolves around a system where they are the sun of their universe rather than ever having realized how to interact with the galaxies beyond them." side="left">revolves around a system where they are the sun of their universe rather than ever having realized how to interact with the galaxies beyond them.</author>

Left to `wonder why` they are not like the rest, they resort to [Attention Seeking Behavior](/post/appetite/) because it's the only outlet that continually gets them a response. Yet, the feat they only receive the response only continues to perpetuate the outcome.

Although annoying, these people are also a sign that you are reaching the point of escape velocity. For if these people are not around you, you are still miles away from having an audience that is willing to become evangelists.

**How can you easily determine if you are this phase?**

- Are you getting a lot of bug reports that include zero information and just bring a bug like a child?
- Are you experiencing situations where the user is so incredibly inept that they don't even have the ability to verbalize or communicate an issue?
- Are you getting people saying things that make absolutely zero sense yet they say it confidently?
- Are you experiencing large amounts of misperceptions from the average user?

These are the things that you will not see come in on GitHub. This phase is the one that you will feel deep in your gut that bring the first murmurings of abandoning yet another idea. The type of response and conversations that frustrate you to a feeling that is disgusting and ridiculous.

Interestingly, frustration at these people shows you still have more growing to do. Vasa of [Gem.xyz](https://gem.xyz) has shown through years of effort and dedication that when you take care of these people, they will take care of you. Important to understand though, is that the second you stop giving them attention is the second they will stop being your follower.

Critical to note though, is that these users are precisely the ones that make [[Recursive Product Market Fit]] possible. Without having attention seeking users a builder will never know the solution/product they should build. Like a lighthouse in the middle of a storm, [[Attention Seeking Behavior]] from a user is the sign of a problem that should be solved. If you have not found success with an attempt at building a solution it is merely because the incorrect solution has been built.

## Attention Deprevation

Unlocking the power of the [[Network Effects]], utilizing the power of users with [[Attention Seeking Behavior]] is the simplest way to maintain the momentum that has been built in a niche without losing the expertise and understanding that has been established within a single niche.

Thankfully, we do know this to be possible and wildly successful outside of Web3, we are just very early still. A great example of this is Pieter Levels who has built within the same niches for years.

Constantly evolving his pitch, he is quick to identify problems and deploy possible shapes of the solution. Accepting that nothing is forever, Pieter excels in building products that are made to fit the shape of the active market rather than the shape of his wants. With [[Recursive Product Market Fit]] Pieter has been able to find constant and repeatable success resulting in many believing it to be his following that permits this ability.

However that is not the case although a high specialized audience is the outcome of it. Having cultivated an audience of users with high-levels of [[Attention Seeking Behavior]] now countless builders follow and idolize Pieter without ever having realized that his greatest attribute is that he does not give up nor does he believe that his first solution is the only solution.
