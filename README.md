> A variant representation in search of a non-modulated digital lifestyle.

This is the repository that houses the primary thought-engine of all things CHANCE. As home of all variants and their outputs, eventually all things must die and make their way to the _Library of Variants_. This repository is a time-capsule of the progression and change through time as life has unfolded. Rather than obessing over a green activity bubble, CHANCE is a different form of creating and preserving ones digital pyramids.
