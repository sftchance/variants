        content: "[Arkham](https://www.arkhamintelligence.com/) has entered the web3 industry without any of its founders having a huge following before or after building. Even when the product is rather known today and has gone through multiple rounds of funding, the prime founder still only has 500 followers.\n\n![[Pasted image 20221217160013.png]]\n\nThis is just one of many reference points that illustrates multiple points but primarily:\n\n1. Your business can be successful without you being viral, known on Twitter, or really even posting. All that is needed is a good product that can be talked about.\n2. Miguel has 106 tweets and 90% of them are about the product.\n   1. Shitposting can do more harm than good, especially for investors.\n\nMeanwhile, the company Twitter has 37k followers.\n\n![[Pasted image 20221217160231.png]]\n\nThey built a product that users enjoy and value and that has resulted in a community that shows up and supports the company. This is nicely illustrated with the metrics of their **product-focused tweets** such as: https://twitter.com/ArkhamIntel/status/1579812848758587392?s=20&t=YBwR2Sz13K_VUxLdvEfPA\n\n![[Pasted image 20221217160324.png]]\n\nInterestingly, while the company has not strayed away from shitposting, Arkham has also shown that one does not have to be completely serious to market a very serious and very good product.\n\n![[Pasted image 20221217160411.png]]\n\nArkham is a great example of the land that many products aspire to stand in. They have taken a far more meme-heavy route and have a managed person leading the social media now. While that may be the case one day for Cogs, that is not the case on Day 0.\n\nTo siphon the wisdom for Arkham, Cogs will lead the topical and emergent things such as [[Content Topics]] while also utilization [[Content Marketing]] for more long-term and longtail focuses.\n\n> Just because you do not have a following when starting, does not mean your [[Total Addressable Market]] is any smaller than the next guys.",

When you collect Event Horizons together though you put your business at extreme risk.\n\nHow? **Event Horizons create alliances.**\n\nA truly effective Event Horizon has identified that the Network Effect is the most powerful tool they have in their arsenal. Not reliant on any one company or any single idea, an Event Horizon has the true ability to remain nimble (likely because they have always had to be.)\n\nUnfortunately for the company though, Event Horizons assemble to become a Black Hole that destroys everything in its path.\n\n![[Pasted image 20230122105330.png]]\n\nWhile a company views the integration of an Event Horizon as an asset, is an increasing liability that puts the company and all team members at risk with the strong reliance and _key-man_ inclusion that requires significant change when the team disperses.\n\nIn the past week and with the acquired understanding of [[We Are The Resources]] this is already becoming an issue for Flipside and we are only 5 months into employment:\n\nUnfortunately though, this is the perfect display of Event Horizons coming together to create blackholes.\n\nIf something happened to Meg, Drake cannot go back in time and will not take that role which means Drake will begin looking for a new job and figuring out how to adjust to the change without traveling back in time.\n\nFocusing on event horizons to an extreme degree is a severe mistake that only leaders incapable of the process of execution will choose to support.\n\nSupporting event horizons with freedom is not the choice of a smart CEO or one that knows where they are going, they are lost to an extreme degree putting the trust in people they literally cannot comprehend the thoughts of.",

It has been shown, for instance, that the goal to perform a certain task accurately can be primed, so that the agent pursues the goal without any awareness of doing so (Bargh et al. 2001). There is a large body of research on this, and it has been suggested that this research shows that *most* of our actions are executed automatically and without conscious control (Bargh and Chartrand 1999, Custers and Aarts 2010).[[22](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/agency/notes.html#note-22)] This claim is less radical than the claims put forward by Libet (1999) and Wegner (2002), as it concerns only the extent or scope of conscious control.\n\n> Dual System Theory",

This brought the research into [[Discerete Cosine Transform]] which aimed to connect a few of the dots and re-discover a new/better way to handle an insane amount of data.\n\nThe aim is to have multiple operational curves for:\n\n- amount of work requests\n- amount of service providers\n- amount of quality enforcers\n\nA critical nuance the ability of using a transform here is that the interval of writing must be constant otherwise everything falls apart rapidly.",
